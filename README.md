# Stationeers Player Communications

Player Communications adds immersive voice chat to Stationeers, allowing players to communicate face-to-face or over long distances using radios.

## Features
- **Face-to-Face Voice Chat**: Voices are affected by environmental factors such as pressure, helmets, and world occlusion.
- **Directional Audio**: When speaking face-to-face, players' voices are heard based on their position and orientation, adding realism to communication.
- **Radio Communication**: Enables long-range communication between players.
- **Radio Channels**: Up to 16 Radio Channels
- **Radio Storage**: A Radio Storage in the Locker Kit.
- **Radio Tower**: A Radio Tower to increase signal strength and Transmission/Reception distance.
- **Steam Voice Integration**: Uses Steam's built-in voice chat system for reliable communication.

## Requirements
To use this mod, you must have Steam initialized when launching the game.
You must have StationeersMods and BepInEx installed. See https://jixxed.github.io/StationeersMods/

## Setup Instructions
1. Open your **Steam Voice Settings**.
2. Select your **input source** (microphone).
3. Choose your preferred transmission mode:
   - **Push to Talk (Recommended)**: Only transmits when you press the designated key.
   - **Continuous Transmission**: Always transmits your voice, though this is not realistic and may pick up background noise.

## Notes
- Helmets, atmospheric pressure, and objects in the environment can impact how voice chat is transmitted and received.
- Voices are **directional**, meaning you will hear players based on their position when speaking face-to-face, unless they are using a radio.
- Ensure your microphone is properly configured in Steam before launching the game.

## Troubleshooting
- If voice chat is not working, check that Steam is running and that your microphone is correctly set up in Steam Voice Settings.
- Make sure your **push-to-talk** key (if selected) is properly bound in Steam.

Enjoy realistic player communications in Stationeers!
